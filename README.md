# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Learning
In this unsupervised learning assignment, I used data for crypto currency(dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC). 
The assignment consists of following steps:
 >Preparing the Data
 >Finding the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
 >Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
 >Optimising Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
 >Finding the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
 >Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

Finally, Visualising and Comparing the Results to determine the best K value and supporting the assumption made by using elbow curve.
